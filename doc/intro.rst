Introduction

This document describes the AstroFaker python module. AstroFaker provides
mixin classes that add methods to the standard AstroData classes
of DRAGONS. These methods allow the construction of artificial data that
behave within DRAGONS like real astronomical data but whose properties can
be carefully controlled to aid with the development and testing of
software.

This document is intended to present the application programming interface
(API) for AstroFaker and present examples of the package's usage. Since the
primary purpose of the package is to enable the writing of tests for
DRAGONS, it is expected that anybody using AstroFaker will possess a level
of programmining abilirt and have a degree of familiarity with AstroData
and DRAGONS.
